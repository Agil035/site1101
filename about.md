          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            I am a first-year undergraduate student majoring in Information Technology at ADA University. I graduated from school as the top student and completed my secondary education with a gold certificate (gold medal and gold diploma), reflecting strong academic performance and discipline.
          </p>

          <p>
            My admission to ADA University was supported by my achievement in the Republican Informatics Olympiad (RFO), where I earned a medal in informatics. This experience strengthened my analytical thinking and motivated me to continue my education in technology and computing.

          <h3>Qualifications</h3>
          <p>
            I hold an IELTS score of 7.5, demonstrating strong proficiency in academic English, which supports my ability to study, communicate, and write effectively in an English-taught environment. Through my IT studies, I am developing skills in programming, problem-solving, and logical reasoning. I have also completed Academic Writing coursework, improving my argumentation, research-based writing, and critical analysis, and I actively participate in academic and informatics-related activities that support my development.
