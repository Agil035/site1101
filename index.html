                <p>
                    I was born in Sumgait, Azerbaijan. I completed my secondary education at Saray Secondary School No. 3 in the Absheron district, where I demonstrated strong academic performance and was selected as the top student of my school. During my school years, I actively participated in Mathematics and Informatics Olympiads, which contributed to the development of my analytical thinking, logical reasoning, and problem-solving skills. These experiences played a significant role in shaping my interest in technology and exact sciences. I have always been motivated to challenge myself academically and continuously improve my knowledge and skills through discipline and perseverance. Currently, I am a first-year undergraduate student at ADA University, studying Information Technology. I am focused on developing both academically and professionally by combining my analytical background with practical, project-based learning and technical skills.
