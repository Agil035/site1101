I am a first-year undergraduate student majoring in Information Technology at ADA University, with a strong academic background in informatics and analytical thinking. My admission to ADA University was supported by my achievement in the Republican Informatics Olympiad (RFO), where I earned a medal, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills, discipline, and academic commitment.

Academic Background

In terms of qualifications, I hold an IELTS score of 7.5, reflecting a high level of proficiency in academic English, and a SAT score of 1370, highlighting solid skills in mathematics, critical reading, and logical reasoning. These results demonstrate my preparedness for a rigorous and competitive academic environment.

Throughout my studies, I have completed coursework in Academic Writing, where I developed skills in structured argumentation, research-based writing, and critical analysis. As part of this coursework, I worked on an individual project that involved researching a contemporary global issue, analyzing credible sources, and presenting well-organized written arguments.

In addition to coursework, I actively engage in self-directed learning and practical projects related to information technology and problem-solving. Currently, I am a SITE 1101 student, learning web development and building foundational skills in creating structured, responsive, and accessible websites. I am motivated to continuously improve my technical and academic skills and apply them through collaborative and project-based work.
